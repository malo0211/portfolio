# My Portfolio

## About the Project
This website works as a portfolio to exhibit my skills, previous work, as well my personal brand that I am evolving with. I wanted to showcase a mix of simplicity, elegance, and trendiness. I used pictures I have taken in place of designs because I am still working on what I want to display. My main goal is to present myself as a web and graphic designer, as well as a video editor, rather than a photographer. In addition, the idea is to eventually code a hover function; when the image is hovered over the picture will return to it's original colours. When clicke dit will open into its own page with details about the peice or project. 

### Challenges Faced
I faced some layout challenges:
- having certain elements appear on some pages but not others
- some elements felt too crowded/squished in some layouts
- having the mobile container different from the tablet and laptop layouts
- picture sizing and fitting the pictures equally into the grid

### Challenges Overcome
-  I made use of unique id and class tags for pages that had similar settings but differed from other pages. I added in a number to the class or id and copied the CSS to that new element, making the minute changes that I needed.
- I made media queries for some items that needed their own breakpoints, for example, some images do not appear on mobile but do appear on the larger layouts. However, midway through the tablet layout would make the content look really squished. So my solution was to set their own media queries so I could really control when they would appear.
- I changed the container width on mobile by changing from a default container width of 80% on the entire site, to setting container width to each breakpoint. For mobile it was 100% and I set padding to each item - so that it appeared to be in the 80% container but images and a background element could span the width of the screen. The larger sizes all kept the 80% container.
- I figured out how to use viewport width and viewport height to achieve the responsivemness that I wanted with the grids. I also learned how to implement the  object-fit:cover code - so as images were responding, they were maintaing the same size as the other items in the grid. 

### What I Learned
I learned how grids, flex, and layout can work with multiple breakpoints and how to make things do what you want them to. It requires time, effort, little tweaks,  and attention ot detail, but ultimately, almost anything is possible with HTML and CSS. These concepts and technqiues have been soldified in my brain and I find my understanding much greater than it was last semester - and even throughout this semester.

### Assets Used
